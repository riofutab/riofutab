Hi, I’m carlo — an electrical and automatic control researcher from Chengdu University of Technology. I’m still chasing the same dream: turning rigorous engineering principles into practical tools that actually help people. Most days, though, it’s just me, a worn-out laptop and a few second-hand components scattered across a tiny desk.

What I’m Building (With Bare Hands)

Smart Grid Tools: lightweight software and libraries to make energy systems more efficient and reliable.

Automation & Robotics: practical control frameworks that move research from theory into motion.

Learning Resources: open materials for students and engineers who want to learn but lack access to expensive labs.

Why I Need Support

Research without funding is brutally hard. Hardware fails, hosting costs stack up, and each prototype eats into my savings. I keep pushing through long nights to keep my open-source work alive — tools that can make learning and innovation more accessible to others.

Your sponsorship helps me keep going:

More time for development and testing, less time struggling to cover expenses.

Proper equipment and validation tools for real-world experiments.

Open sharing — every success, every setback, every lesson made public.

What Sponsors Get

Early access to projects, code, and progress notes.

A voice in direction — suggest improvements or vote on what comes next.

Transparency — honest monthly updates on what’s working and what’s not.

Join Me in Keeping This Alive

If you still believe in independent engineering — research powered by curiosity, not corporations — please consider supporting this work.
Every contribution, big or small, helps an underfunded engineer stay focused on building tools that truly matter.

Thank you for reading, and for helping carlo keep creating through perseverance and passion.
