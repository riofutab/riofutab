Hi, I’m carlo — an electrical & automatic control researcher from Chengdu University of Technology. I’m still chasing one simple idea: turn rigorous engineering into tools people can actually use. Most days, it’s just me, a worn-out laptop, and second-hand parts on a tiny desk. 🧰💻

🔧 What I’m Building (on a shoestring)

🏭 Smart Grid Tools: lightweight libraries to make energy systems more efficient and reliable.

🤖 Automation & Robotics: practical control frameworks that move ideas from theory into motion.

📘 Learning Resources: clear, open materials for students and busy engineers without fancy labs.

🥀 Why I Need Support

Research without funding is tough: hardware fails, hosting bills pile up, and prototypes eat what little savings I have. I keep pushing through late nights to keep open-source work alive—because it helps others learn and build. Your support means:

⏱️ More time for R&D and testing, less time scrambling for side gigs.

🔬 Real equipment & validation, not just simulations.

🔁 Open sharing: code, notes, and reproducible builds—successes and failures alike.

🎁 What Sponsors Get

🚀 Early access to repos, prototypes, and field notes (warts and all).

🧭 A say in direction: vote on priorities, request benchmarks, shape the roadmap.

📯 Transparent monthly updates on what shipped, what broke, and what’s next.

🤝 Join Me in Keeping This Alive

If you believe independent engineering still matters—work powered by perseverance more than budgets—please consider supporting this journey. Every bit helps an underfunded engineer keep building tools that make a real difference. 🌱

Thank you for reading—and for helping carlo keep creating against the odds. 🙏✨
